**Learning:** In a Telegram Mini App context, integrating native haptic feedback (`window.Telegram.WebApp.HapticFeedback`) significantly improves the perceived "feel" of virtual hardware controls (knobs, sliders, buttons) by providing tactile confirmation that mirrors physical equipment.
**Action:** Always check for `window.Telegram?.WebApp?.HapticFeedback` availability and integrate `selectionChanged` for continuous controls and `impactOccurred` for discrete actions.

**Learning:** Hidden range inputs used for rotary knobs and sliders require explicit `aria-label` attributes to be useful for assistive technologies, as the visual label might not be programmatically associated with the input.
**Action:** Ensure all `input[type="range"]` elements, especially those styled to look like knobs, have descriptive `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

**Learning:** Custom interactive elements (like drum pads) using `div` for layout flexibility must be manually augmented with `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, and `onKeyDown` (Space/Enter) to ensure keyboard parity with mouse interactions.
**Action:** Always verify that non-native interactive elements are focusable and triggerable via keyboard.
